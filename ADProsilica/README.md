An 
[EPICS](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/) 
[areaDetector](https://github.com/areaDetector/areaDetector/blob/master/README.md) 
driver for Gigabit Ethernet and Firewire cameras from 
[Allied Vision Technologies](https://www.alliedvision.com),
who purchased Prosilica. 
The driver is supported under Windows, Linux and Mac OS X using the 
vendor library provided for those operating systems.

**NOTE:** This driver uses the obsolete Prosilica FlyCap2 SDK.
Users are encouraged to switch to the [ADVimba](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADVimba) driver,
which uses the newer AVT Vimba SDK.
