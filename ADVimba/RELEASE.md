Release Notes
=============
R1-4 (July 20, 2023)
----
* Updated the version of the Vimba SDK being used to 6.0.
  Windows users will need to install Vimba 6.0 to get the correct drivers and DLLs.
  Linux users do not need to do anything because the 6.0 files are all included in ADVimba.
* Removed support for 32-bit Linux and Windows.
* Added protection against crash if a camera is disconnected.  Thanks to Xiaoqiang Wang for this.

R1-3 (October 2, 2020)
----
* Updated the version of the Vimba SDK being used to 4.0 (Windows) and 4.1 (Linux).
  Windows users will need to install Vimba 4.0 to get the correct drivers and DLLs.
  Linux users do not need to do anything because the 4.1 files are all included in ADVimba.
* Added automatic packet size negotiation for GigE cameras in the constructor.
  Previously cameras would default to jumbo packets, and if the network did not support that
  then streaming would fail until the packet size feature was decreased.
* The transport layer statistics are now updated each time an image is received, independent
  of whether the ReadStatus record is processed. Changed the OPI display to make that clear.
* Minor change to allow the driver to work on EPICS 3.14.12.

R1-2 (April 9, 2020)
----
* Fix problem with the packet and frame statistics records. 
  They were not updating because the DTYP needed to be changed from asynInt32 to asynInt64.
* Add .bob files for Phoebus Display Manager
