ADVimba
===========
An 
[EPICS](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics)
[areaDetector](https://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetector.html)
driver for cameras from 
[Allied Vision](http://www.alliedvision.com) using their Vimba SDK.
These include GigE and USB-3 cameras.  

Allied Vision purchased Prosilica, and this driver is a replacement for the ADProsilica driver
that is based on the PvAPI SDK, and which is now obsolete.

ADVimba is based on [ADGenICam](https://areadetector.github.io/master/ADGenICam/ADGenICam.html), 
which handles many of the details of mapping GenICam features to EPICS records.
