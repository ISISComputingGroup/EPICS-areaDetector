ADEiger
===========
An
[EPICS](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/)
[areaDetector](https://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetector.html)
driver for the Eiger pixel array detectors from
[Dectris](http://www.dectris.com).

Additional information:
* [Release notes](RELEASE.md).

Notes:
------

* Depends on the Eiger having the firmware 1.6.4 or newer.
* Depends on ADCore R2-6 or newer.
* Currently this was only tested on Linux 64-bit machines.
* ~~ADEiger is currently incompatible with ADSupport's hdf5 because ADEiger depends on hdf5_hl.~~
    * ADSupport R1-3 now provides hdf5_hl

Before compiling:
-----------------

* Set `ZMQ` variables inside `ADEiger/configure/CONFIG_SITE` to point to a ZeroMQ installation location if a system package is not installed (`libzmq3-dev` on Debian systems).
  - ZeroMQ 4 is required

HDF5 Plugins:
-------------

If you want ADEiger to decode compressed data produced by the detector, you will have to have a couple of decompression
plugins compiled and on the path:

* Bitshuffle:

Available [here](https://github.com/kiyo-masui/bitshuffle).

* LZ4:

Deprecated version available [here](https://github.com/michaelrissi/HDF5Plugin.git).
New version available [here](https://github.com/nexusformat/HDF5-External-Filter-Plugins).

Once they are compiled, add their paths to the environment variable `HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH`, separated by a colon.

How to run:
-----------

* Under `ADEiger/iocs/eigerIOC/iocBoot/iocEiger/` there is already a ready to use IOC:
  - Change the IP address in `st.cmd`.
  - Run `./st.cmd`.
* There is a CS-Studio screen under `areaDetector/ADEiger/eigerApp/op/opi`, just use it with Controls System Studio.
