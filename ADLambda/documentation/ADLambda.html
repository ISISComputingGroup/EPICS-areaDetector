   <h2 id="Introduction" style="text-align: left">Introduction</h2>
   <p>
      This is an <a href="https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics">EPICS</a> <a
         href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetector.html">
         areaDetector</a> driver for the Lambda detector from <a
         href="http://www.x-spectrum.de">X-spectrum</a>
   </p>
   <p>The interface to the detector is provided by a TCP/UDP/IP
      socket interface to the detector.  X-Spectrum provides a library to handle 
      communications and acquisition in the camera.  This driver provides an
      interface layer between the vendor library and EPICS areaDetector.</p>
      
   <p>The hardware interface between the camera and the controlling computer 
   consists of </p>
   <ul>
      <li>A single 1GB copper network link used for command/control</li>
      <li>A pair of 10GB Fiber network links for sending image data</li>
   </ul>

   <p>This detector is capable of acquiring up to 2000 images/sec.  It
   may be necessary, therefore, to adapt standard areaDetector plugins for 
   faster collection to ensure processing of all images. 
   </p>
   <h2 id="StandardNotes" style="text-align: left">Implementation
      of standard driver parameters</h2>
    <p>The following table describes how the Lambda driver implements some of the
    standard driver parameters.</p>

   <h2 id="Configuration">Configuration</h2>
   <p>
   The Lambda detector instance is created using the LambdaConfig command, either from C/C++ 
   or from the EPICS IOC shell.
   </p> 
   <pre> int LambdaConfig(const char *portName, const char* configPath, 
         int maxBuffers, size_t maxMemory, 
         int priority, int stackSize)</pre>
         
   <p>
   For details on the meaning of the parameters to this function refer to the documentation
   on the LambdaConfig function in the <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/ADLambda_8cpp.html">Lambda.cpp documentation</a></p> and in 
   the documentation for the constructor in the <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_ADLambda.html">ADLambda class</a>)

   <h2 id="Performance_Measurements">Performance measurements</h2>
    <p>The Lambda detector itself is rated at 2000 frames/sec.  This rate has been achieved simply processing the 
    detector images into NDArrays.  We have been able to save up to 2000 images/sec for a period of time using 
    a PipeWriterPlugin that writes to a Unix Pipe which feeds an external MPI program which compresses the
    image data and writes to a binary file with occasional bad frame errors.  Sometimes the detector seems to 
    persist giving bad frames once it gets started and the detector has to be reset.  
    Sometimes we lose communication with the detector through the 1GB command 
    interface.  When this happens we have to power down the detector for about 10
    minutes before it will come on again.
    </p>

   <h2 id="Hardware_Notes">Hardware Notes</h2>
   <p>This detector is capable of supporting a number of features which are not currently available in the detector 
   driver & firmware.  These features will be added as they are made available by the vendor.</p>


   <h2 id="Restrictions">Restrictions</h2>
   <p>To be added later...</p>
