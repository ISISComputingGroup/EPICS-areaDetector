To build the liblambda for use with EPICS areaDetector, perform the following commands from within the 
LambdaSuppport directory: 

#create directories from the build information
mkdir liblambda-build
mkdir liblambda-linux-x86_64
#change directory to the build directory
cd liblambda-build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../liblambda-linux-x86_64 ../liblambda
#Build the code
make
#Install into liblambda-<EpicsHostArch> 
make install
# Go back to LambdaSupport
cd ..
# This make will happen as part of areaDetector build, It installs headers
# and libraries in ADLambda/lib, include, etc so that it will be found by EPICS builds.
make
